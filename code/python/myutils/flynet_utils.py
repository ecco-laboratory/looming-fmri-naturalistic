# for ONE unit:
# the first dimension is (flattened) pixel weights
# comes in as 144, aka 12x12
# the second dimension is cardinal direction: R, L, U, D in that order
# If the RF for each unit is a circle, the corner weights should be set to 0

# Each unit appears to have the same weights
# just with a different RF center

# From Baohua's code on GitHub:
# UV_flow_t: tensor, flow field at time point t, shape = batch_size by M by K*K by 4
# So remember: We are NOT operating in actual-pixel space, we are operating in RF space
# so the k-by-k'th pixel weight in unit m's RF does not correspond
# to the same actual-pixel as the k-by-k'th pixel weight in unit m+1's RF

# tensordot of a 3D flow tensor (indexing a single flow direction) with the weights (144x1)
# seems to yield an output size batch x m x 1
# making me think that a linear layer WILL do the same thing

# The model is ReLU(weighted sum of directional weights*flow values)
# Flatten? and then linear to get weighted sum? and then ReLU the linear output?
# Baohua's code appears to
